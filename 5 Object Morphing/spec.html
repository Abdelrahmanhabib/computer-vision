    <h1>HW5: Face Morphing</h1>
    <h3> Due Monday, March 20th in EEE DropBox at 11:59 pm </h3>
    <hr>

    In this assignment you will produce a "morph" animation of one face
    into another.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fowlkes/class/cs116/hwk5/downloads/">downloads</a> contains some skeleton code for you to start with
    </li></ul>
 
    <h4>Programming [90 points]</h4>

    Write the following 3 functions (each in their own file) with the following
    prototypes to perform the morph.
    
    <ol>
      
	<hr>
	<p></p><li><b>[30 points]</b> 
  This function computes the affine transformation which maps points from tri1
  to tri2.  You will use this to map pixels inside each triangle of your mesh.

	<blockquote><tt><pre>  function T = ttform(tri1,tri2)
  %
  % compute the transformation T which maps points
  % of triangle1 to triangle2 
  %
  %  tri1 : 2x3 matrix containing coordinates of triangle 1
  %  tri2 : 2x3 matrix containing coordinates of triangle 2
  %
  %  T : the resulting transformation, should be a 3x3
  %      matrix which operates on points described in 
  %      homogeneous coordinates 
  %
	</pre></tt></blockquote>
	<hr>

	<p></p></li><li><b>[30 points]</b> 
  This function computes a warped image starting from a source image and a
  set of triangulated keypoints.  You will want to use MATLAB's built in
  function for interpolation <b>interp2</b> to perform the warping for each
  triangle.  In order to determine which pixels fall in a given triangle
  we will use <b>poly2mask</b>.
  
	<blockquote><tt><pre>  function I_warped = warp(I_source,pts_source,pts_target,tri)
  %
  % I_source : color source image  (HxWx3)
  % pts_source : coordinates of keypoints in the source image  (2xN)
  % pts_target : coordinates of where the keypoints end up after the warp (2xN)
  % tri : list of triangles (triples of indices into pts_source)  (Kx3)
  %       for example, the coordinates of the kth triangle should be 
  %       given by the expression:
  %
  %           pts_source(:,tri(k,:))
  % 
  %
  % I_warped : resulting warped image, same size as source image (HxWx3)
  %
</pre></tt></blockquote>
  <hr>

	<p></p></li><li><b>[30 points]</b> 
  Write a script <b>morph.m</b> that loads in the source and target image
  and produces a morph between them.  The script should let the user click on 
  corresponding keypoints in each image to indicate correspondences.  It should
  then triangulate the set of points (using the MATLAB function
  <b>delaunay</b>) and then produce a morph sequence by repeatedly warping the
  source and target images to an intermediate image and blending them.

  NOTE: you may want to save user clicks out to a file and just load them
  in so that you don't have to keep recreating them while testing your other 
  code.

	<blockquote><tt><pre>  %
  % morphing script
  %

  % load in two images...

  % get user clicks on keypoints

  % generate triangulation 
  tri = delaunay(...) 

  % now produce a nframe morph sequence
  nframes = 30;
  for fnum = 1:nframes
    t = (fnum-1)/(nframes-1);
    pts_target = (1-t)*pts_img1 + t*pts_img2;                % intermediate key-point locations
    I1_warp = warp(I1,pts_img1,pts_target,tri);              % warp image 1
    I2_warp = ...                                            % warp image 2
    Iresult = (1-t)*I1_warp + t*I2_warp;                     % blend the two warped images

    figure(1); clf; imagesc(Iresult); axis image; drawnow;   % display the frame

    imwrite(Iresult,sprintf('frame_%2.2d.jpg',fnum),'jpg')   % save the frame to a jpg file
  end
  </pre></tt></blockquote>
	<hr>

    </li></ol>

    <h4>Writeup and Results [10 points]</h4>
    For the writeup you should include results for two different morph
    sequences of your own choosing.  At least one sequence should be a
    morph between two faces.  For the second sequence you can try using
    a different object if you prefer.

    For each sequence your writeup should show a 5 frame version of the
    morphing sequence where frame 1 is the first image, frame 5 is the last
    image and you show three equally spaced intermediate frames.
    
    
    <h4>Hints and More Discussion</h4>
    You will need to define pairs of corresponding points on the two
    images by hand (the more points, the better the morph, generally). The
    simplest way is probably to use the <em>cpselect</em> tool or write your own 
    tool using ginput and plot commands (with hold on and hold off). Rember
    to click on the points in the same order!
    
    Now, you need to provide a triangulation of these points that will be used
    for morphing. You can compute a triangulation any way you like, or even
    define it by hand. A Delaunay triangulation (see delaunay and related
    functions) is a good choice since it does not produce overly skinny
    triangles. You can compute the Delaunay triangulation on either of the
    point sets (but not both -- the triangulation has to be the same throughout
    the morph!).  A reasonable approach is to compute the triangulation at
    midway shape (i.e. mean of the two point sets) to lessen the potential
    triangle deformations. <p> 

    In order to get nice looking results you will probably want to click on
    lots of corresponding points (~20).  You should also add the 4 corners
    of the image to your list of source and target points so that the background
    gets mapped appropriately.</p><p>

    MATLAB has a function <b>poly2mask</b> which takes a list of points
    defining a polygon and returns a binary image indicating which pixels are
    inside the polygon and which are outside.  You should use this function 
    in order to determine which pixels fall inside each triangle so you can
    warp them appropriately.
